# binarySearchGuessingGame
Practice implementing binary search by creating a game where the computer guesses your number in as few tries as possible. Introduced to the concept of algorithms and started on practicing with one of the most common and basic ones. 

Current code has the computer calculate the minimum number of tries it can take to correctly guess the user's number and treat that minimum as the maximum it should take for it to figure it out outside of actually guessing it correctly before that limit.
